# Augmented_Tactics
Augmented Tactics is an open source project which aims to build an Android game as a community effort.
This an augmented reality game created using the Unity3D game engine and the C# language. The game is turn-based game of the likes of Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem.
The owner was concious that using scripts in Unity provides an exit way out to clean code and just write that works. He designed a solution that's build on many design patterns such as Strategy, Inversion of control or Command. 

Starting January 2016, the owner accepts pull requests from the Augmented Tactics game. Currently, there are many unit tests that are present in the code base but are yet to be written. Unit tests were added to the project because it was developped using TDD. Under duress by the timeframe for the project, it was impossible to finish writting all the tests before handing out the project by the end of fall term. 

Moreover, the current version of the game is a prototype of a turn based game. 
It is not yet a game. This is where the community can get evolve. Create levels, a story, different level of intelligence for the AI, create new models for the characters, etc. It is up to you to decide what you would like to give to the project. Anything is appreciated !

At first, this started as a credited project at school where I had to create a prototype with augmented reality and the voice of the player to create new way to play with mobile devices. But with a limited time frame (3 months) it was only possible to create the prototype with the augmented reality.I'm thinking that the voice could come later in the project. It would be better to have a story and levels before trying to get out of hand with voice detection. 

If you would like to propose something new, please open an issue and I will review it. I'm sure we can quickly come to an understanding and easily try to add your feature(s) or item(s) in the game. Looking forward to work with all of you !
